The Rules of Blackjack

Here're the "official" rules that your game must follow.

Objective

The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a higher card total without going over 21.

The Deck of Cards

Blackjack is played with a standard set of 52 poker cards. Each of the 52 cards belongs to a specific suit (Hearts, Spades, Clubs, or Diamonds) and has one of 13 denominations (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, or King).

Card Values

For the purposes of Blackjack, all suits are irrelevant, so it doesn't matter if you have the two of hearts or the two of clubs.

Card Type	Value
Ace (A)	1 or 11
2	2
3	3
4	4
5	5
6	6
7	7
8	8
9	9
10	10
Jack (J)	10
Queen (Q)	10
King (K)	10
Definitions

These are the terms that you'll see in these rules and, ostensibly, at a Blackjack table in Reno.

Blackjack
Not just the name of the game, this is also the name of the two-card hand where the player (including the dealer) has an Ace and a card worth 10 points.
Hole
The dealer's card that is face down
Hit
IF a player wants to be "hit", that means they'd like another card from the deck to increase their hands' total.
Stand
If a player "stands", then this means they no longer want to receive more cards.
Bust
When a player's hand's value exceeds 21 points, then that hand has "busted" and that player has lost.
How to Play

The flow of Blackjack is fairly simple.

Players place bets before the dealer gives them any cards
The dealer deals two cards face up to each player. The dealer receives one card face up and one face down.
The dealer asks each player, in turn, whether they want to hit or stand.
If a player wants another card, they will say "Hit me" and the dealer will give them another card.
If a player's hand has "busted", then their turn has ended and they forfeit their bet.
Once all players have "stood" or "busted", then the dealer reveals the hole card and takes cards until the dealer's hand is greater than 16 points.
Payouts to players are based on the final scores of their hand in relation to the dealer's hand.
The cards are gathered and put to the side and the dealer deals another round of cards. If the dealer runs out of cards, they will pick up the used cards, shuffle them, and continue the deal.
Payouts

After all of the play of a round, the dealer pays players based on the following scores.

You have	The dealer has	You get paid
Busted	Anything	Nothing and lose your bet
Blackjack	Not Blackjack	3 to 2, so if you bet $20, the dealer pays you $30
Blackjack	Blackjack	You keep your money
<= 21	Busted	2 to 1, so if you bet $20, the dealer gives you $20 more
<= 21	less than you	2 to 1, so if you bet $20, the dealer gives you $20 more
less than the dealer	<= 21	Nothing and lose your bet
the same as the dealer	the same as you	Nothing but get to keep your bet
Grading Scale

For this project, ugly and pretty do not matter. It's all about the gameplay.

For Complete and Satisfactory

Your Blackjack game must make use of object-oriented principles to be judged complete and satisfactory.

Your Blackjack game must be able to do the following for your project to receive the Complete and Satisfactory rating.

Have a shuffled deck of 52 playing cards at the start of the game
Be able to play Blackjack until the deck is empty
Keep a proper running total of how much money the plaeyer has
Not allow the player to continue if the player run out of money
Follow the rules in How to Play and the Payouts table
You do not have to show fancy graphics or the suit of the cards in a player's hand because suits don't matter
For Exceeds Expectations

If your Blackjack game meets all of the criteria for Complete and Satisfactory and has any of the following features, then you will receive Exceeds Expectations.

Doubling Down: Allow the player to double their bet after receiving their first two cards. The player can then receive only one additional card.
Split a Hand: If the player receives two cards of the same number, the player can split them into two separate hands if they have enough money to place the same bet on the newly-formed hand. The dealer will then give one additional card to each hand.
Insurance: If the dealer’s face up card is an ace, he will offer players the option of buying insurance. If the player chooses to buy insurance, then the player can then wager half of the original bet (in addition to it) that the dealer does have Blackjack. If the dealer does have Blackjack, the player's insurance is paid 2 to 1 but the original bet is lost (meaning you break even for the hand). If the dealer does not have Blackjack, then the player loses the insurance.
Even Money: If the player has Blackjack and the dealer has an ace showing, the dealer will offer the player even money for their Blackjack (instead of 3 to 2). If the player does not take it and the dealer also has Blackjack, the player will have a push just like normal.
