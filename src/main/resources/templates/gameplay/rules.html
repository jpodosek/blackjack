<p>Let's play some Blackjack without real money and without real consequences!</p>
<p>This assignment is broken down into the minimum for <em>Complete and
Satisfactory</em> and, then, optional pieces, any of which will be valued as
<em>Exceeds Expectations</em>.</p>
<h1>The Rules of Blackjack</h1>
<p>Here're the "official" rules that your game must follow.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a higher card total
without going over 21.</p>
<h2>The Deck of Cards</h2>
<p>Blackjack is played with a standard set of 52 poker cards. Each of the 52
cards belongs to a specific suit (Hearts, Spades, Clubs, or Diamonds) and has
one of 13 denominations (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, or
King).</p>
<h2>Card Values</h2>
<p>For the purposes of Blackjack, all suits are irrelevant, so it doesn't matter
if you have the two of hearts or the two of clubs.</p>

<div class="m-coursecontent-table-outer"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Card Type</th>
<th>Value</th>

<tbody>

</table></div>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>These are the terms that you'll see in these rules and, ostensibly, at a
Blackjack table in Reno.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Blackjack</dt>
  <dd>
    Not just the name of the game, this is also the name of the two-card hand
    where the player (including the dealer) has an Ace and a card worth 10
    points.
  </dd>
  <dt>Hole</dt>
  <dd>
    The dealer's card that is face down
  </dd>
  <dt>Hit</dt>
  <dd>
    IF a player wants to be "hit", that means they'd like another card from
    the deck to increase their hands' total.
  </dd>
  <dt>Stand</dt>
  <dd>
    If a player "stands", then this means they no longer want to receive more
    cards.
  </dd>
  <dt>Bust</dt>
  <dd>
    When a player's hand's value exceeds 21 points, then that hand has
    "busted" and that player has lost.
  </dd>
</dl>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>The flow of Blackjack is fairly simple.</p>

<ul>
<li>Players place bets before the dealer gives them any cards</li>
<li>The dealer deals two cards face up to each player. The dealer receives one
card face up and one face down.</li>
<li>The dealer asks each player, in turn, whether they want to hit or stand.</li>
<li>If a player wants another card, they will say "Hit me" and the dealer will
give them another card.</li>
<li>If a player's hand has "busted", then their turn has ended and they forfeit
their bet.</li>
<li>Once all players have "stood" or "busted", then the dealer reveals the hole
card and takes cards until the dealer's hand is greater than 16 points.</li>
<li>Payouts to players are based on the final scores of their hand in relation
to the dealer's hand.</li>
<li>The cards are gathered and put to the side and the dealer deals another
round of cards. If the dealer runs out of cards, they will pick up the
used cards, shuffle them, and continue the deal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Payouts</h2>
<p>After all of the play of a round, the dealer pays players based on the
following scores.</p>

<div class="m-coursecontent-table-outer"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>You have</th>
<th>The dealer has</th>
<th>You get paid</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Busted</td>
<td>Anything</td>
<td>Nothing and lose your bet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blackjack</td>
<td>
<strong>Not</strong> Blackjack</td>
<td>3 to 2, so if you bet $20, the dealer pays you $30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blackjack</td>
<td>Blackjack</td>
<td>You keep your money</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;= 21</td>
<td>Busted</td>
<td>2 to 1, so if you bet $20, the dealer gives you $20 more</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;= 21</td>
<td>less than you</td>
<td>2 to 1, so if you bet $20, the dealer gives you $20 more</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>less than the dealer</td>
<td>&lt;= 21</td>
<td>Nothing and lose your bet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>the same as the dealer</td>
<td>the same as you</td>
<td>Nothing but get to keep your bet</td>
</tr>

<h1>Grading Scale</h1>
<p>For this project, ugly and pretty do not matter. It's all about the gameplay.</p>
<h2>For Complete and Satisfactory</h2>
<p>Your Blackjack game must make use of object-oriented principles to be judged
complete and satisfactory.</p>
<p>Your Blackjack game must be able to do the following for your project to
receive the <em>Complete and Satisfactory</em> rating.</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a shuffled deck of 52 playing cards at the start of the game</li>
<li>Be able to play Blackjack until the deck is empty</li>
<li>Keep a proper running total of how much money the plaeyer has</li>
<li>Not allow the player to continue if the player run out of money</li>
<li>Follow the rules in <em>How to Play</em> and the <em>Payouts</em> table (except for the
continue with more cards after they're discarded because you only have to go
through the deck once to get Complete and Satisfactory on this assignment)</li>
<li>You do <em>not</em> have to show fancy graphics or the suit of the cards in a
player's hand because suits don't matter</li>
</ul>
<h2>For Exceeds Expectations</h2>
<p>If your Blackjack game meets all of the criteria for <em>Complete and
Satisfactory</em> and has any of the following features, then you will receive
<em>Exceeds Expectations</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Doubling Down</strong>: Allow the player to double their bet after receiving
their first two cards. The player can then receive only one additional card.</li>
<li>
<strong>Split a Hand</strong>: If the player receives two cards of the same number, the
player can split them into two separate hands if they have enough money to
place the same bet on the newly-formed hand. The dealer will then give one
additional card to each hand.</li>
<li>
<strong>Insurance</strong>: If the dealer’s face up card is an ace, he will offer players
the option of buying insurance. If the player chooses to buy insurance, then
the player can then wager half of the original bet (in addition to it) that
the dealer does have Blackjack. If the dealer does have Blackjack, the
player's insurance is paid 2 to 1 but the original bet is lost (meaning you
break even for the hand). If the dealer does not have Blackjack, then the
player loses the insurance.</li>
<li>
<strong>Even Money</strong>: If the player has Blackjack and the dealer has an ace
showing, the dealer will offer the player even money for their Blackjack
(instead of 3 to 2). If the player does not take it and the dealer also has
Blackjack, the player will have a push just like normal.</li>
